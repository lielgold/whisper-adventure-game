# Whisper Adventure Game

A short tech demo for a voice-operated adventure game, built in Godot 4.2.1 and powered by OpenAI's Whisper for speech recognition.

    "open the door"
    "open the window"

Your commands are transcribed and used to control gameplay.

    🎤 Voice-based input – Use natural sentences to interact with the world.

    🪟 Puzzle solving – Solve short logic puzzles by saying the right commands.
